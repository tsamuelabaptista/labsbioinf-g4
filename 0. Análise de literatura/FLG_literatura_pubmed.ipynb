      "      under high- and low-humidity conditions, utilizing a reconstructed epidermis \n",

      "      RESULTS: Under conditions of low humidity, the proteolysis of FLG in EpiSkin \n",
      "      increased between 4 and 12 h and was accompanied by elevated levels of \n",
      "      cysteine-aspartic protease (caspase)-14. The expression of peptidyl arginine \n",

      "      expression of these three FLG-degrading proteins significantly decreased. \n",
      "      Conversely, the levels of pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid and urocanic acid \n",
      "      initially decreased at 2 h and then increased between 12 and 24 h. Additionally, \n",

      "      exosomes have been recognized as vehicles for intercellular communication. AIMS: \n",
      "      In this study, we aimed to investigate the novel effects of bovine milk-derived \n",
      "      exosomes (MK-Exo) on antiaging in human skin. METHODS: Initially, MK-Exo were \n",
      "      co-cultured with keratinocytes and fibroblasts; subsequent analysis involved qPCR \n",
      "      and western blotting to assess induced gene expression. Subsequently, MK-Exo were \n",
      "      topically applied to the facial skin of 31 female volunteers twice daily for \n",
      "      28 days. The functions were evaluated after conducting safety assessments \n",
      "      in vivo. RESULTS: Purified MK-Exo demonstrated the ability to be taken up \n",
      "      directly by keratinocytes and fibroblasts in vitro, resulting in the upregulation \n",
      "      of natural factors associated with skin moisturization, including filaggrin \n",
      "      (FLG), aquaporin 3 (AQP3), and CD44 in keratinocytes, as well as hyaluronidase \n",
      "      (HAS2) in fibroblasts. Concurrently, MK-Exo promoted fibroblast cell migration \n",
      "      and restored the expression of type I and III collagen (Col I and Col III) \n",
      "      following exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Furthermore, phototoxicity, \n",
      "      photoallergy, repeated skin irritation, skin allergy, and patch tests confirmed \n",
      "      the safety of MK-Exo for skin application. Finally, we elucidated the roles of \n",
      "      MK-Exo in preserving moisture and reducing wrinkles in humans. CONCLUSION: Our \n",
